# shrub.js # 
_when trees are just too tall an order..._

##what-why##
I was working on a project where I needed some collapsible nested lists that would work like trees, and the existing and recomended libraries for treeviews were a bit too involved for my needs.  After trying to adapt my data or html structure to several, I hit jsFiddle and coded a small, fairly simple, very flexible, and slightly easier than rolling your own, plugin that I call shrub.  This is that.

##Work in progress##
this is code that is more or less working in production, but it probably needs a little more love before its ready for general consumption. 

As such, this readme and other documentation are also a work in progress, and I will document its use as the code stabilises.
